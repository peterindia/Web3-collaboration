# Project Aurras

## Project Overview

### Project description
Aurras is a novel and next-generation middleware that acts as an event processor listening to any event from a blockchain database and then propagates it to the registered pool of MQTT brokers. This contributes as a part of the aspect of decentralized push notification. The broader architecture consist of parachain from which the middleware listens for the events.  With this grant, we intend to not only enable Project Aurras to use with Decentralized push notification architecture but also to enable IoT chains to use this tool to send events to IoT devices reliably using MQTT.  

### Values this project bringing to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem
* Core part of Decentralized Push Notification Architecture  
* Can be Used for Business critical and Industry grade IoT devices to listen to events from blockchain  
* Can be used with other microservices

### Components
1. Substrate Event Feed
- Substrate Event Archive (A custom version of [paritytech/substrate-archive](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-archive))
-   

### Technology
1. Apache OpenWhisk
2. Apache Kafka
3. Docker
4. Substrate
5. Rust
6. Go


### Milestone


## Future Plans
Next in the Roadmap is to integrate MQTT brokers to OpenWhisk to open integration of IoT devices and Web Push Notification.  
Combining Aurras, Offchain workers and ability to store OpenWhisk actions code onchain can bring amazing value to the web3 ecosystem.
